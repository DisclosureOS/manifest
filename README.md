DisclosureOS
===========
DisclosureOS is just an extension to AOSP, through which we 
are trying to provide a stock AOSP experience along with some important 
customization features. We have cherry-picked the features from many 
other projects and hence we are very thankful to them.

How to Build?
-------------

To initialize your local repository using the DisclosureOS trees, use a 
command like this:

```bash
  repo init -u git://github.com/DisclosureOS/manifest.git -b pie
```
To initialize a shallow clone, which will save even more space & time, use a command like this:

```bash
  repo init --depth=1 -u git://github.com/DisclosureOS/manifest.git -b pie
```
  
Then to sync up:
----------------

```bash
  repo sync -c -j$(nproc --all) --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags
```
Finally to build:
-----------------

```bash
  . build/envsetup.sh
  lunch aosp_device_codename-userdebug
  mka disclosure -j$(nproc --all) | tee log.txt
```
